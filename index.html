			<p>
				Wonderland Time is a decentralized exchange that uses liquidity pools (LPs) to make markets instead of a typical
				order book. These pools are defined by smart contracts that facilitate the swapping of tokens and the
				adding of liquidity — there are no order books, centralized parties, or central facilitators. Wonderland Time
				users pool two assets that are then traded against, with the price determined by the ratio between the
				two. Anyone with ERC-20 tokens can add liquidity to these pools by adding an equal value of each token
				to the LP. When providing liquidity to an LP, users receive a LP token that is redeemable for the
				underlying assets plus fees at any time, and fees are evenly distributed amongst the individual pool.

			<h2 class="#whatdoes">What Does the Future Hold for Wonderland Time?</h2>

			<p>As they say, imitation is the greatest flattery. Wonderland Time has no shortage of copycats, such as Wonderland Time
				or Wonderland Time DEX. After all, Wonderland Time’s open-source code is easy to copy and slightly tweak. However, after
				initial promises of higher liquidity yields, they deflated while Wonderland Time remained steadfast.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, Wonderland Time’s main obstacle came from Ethereum itself. The biggest smart contract platform
				with over $109B TVL is undergoing a transition itself, from proof-of-work to fully proof-of-stake
				consensus with the upcoming Beacon Chain merger. As a result, Ethereum gas fees have not been
				affordable, to say the least.</p>

				it. However, the most commonly used one is https://app.Wonderland Time.org or https://Wonderland Time.exchange.
